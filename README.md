# premier-league-spending-success
Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between financial spending and on pitch success in the English Premier League. Clubs invest heavily in transfers and wages each season, yet higher spending does not always lead to better outcomes. Using publicly available financial and performance data, this project aims to examine whether financial investment is consistently linked to success and to identify clubs that achieve strong results relative to their spending.

Data Sources

The analysis uses publicly available data from the following sources:
FBref
Transfermarkt
Capology

These sources provide information on league performance, transfers, and wage bills across multiple seasons.

Time Period

The project focuses on Premier League seasons from 2013 to 2024.

Tools and Methods

The analysis is carried out using Python and common data analysis libraries. These include Pandas and NumPy for data handling, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualisation. Jupyter Notebook is used to document the analysis process, and GitHub is used for version control and to track progress throughout the project.

Project Status

Repository setup and initial data exploration.
